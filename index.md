Awesome single cell dataloader created by @jkobject

This data loader is designed to be used with:

- [lamindb](https://lamin.ai/)

and:

- [scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [anndata](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

It allows you to:

1. load thousands of datasets containing millions of cells in a few seconds.
2. preprocess the data per dataset and download it locally (normalization, filtering, etc.)
3. create a more complex single cell dataset
4. extend it to your need

## More

I needed to create this Data Loader for my PhD project. I am using it to load & preprocess thousands of datasets containing millions of cells in a few seconds. I believed that individuals employing AI for single-cell RNA sequencing and other sequencing datasets would eagerly utilize and desire such a tool, which presently does not exist.
