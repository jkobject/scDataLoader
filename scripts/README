# About the scripts

_These scripts file automate some things that I had to do to take care of the
database_

- `rename_obs.py`: this was very useful to rewrite some mistakes I had in the
  obs of my datasets (If you made mistakes you can follow a similar pipeline)
- `run_scbasecount.py` & `finish_scbasecount.py`: the script I use to add
  scbasecount to my database (also look at the notebook for info)
- `addtional.py`: placeholder for other datasets I would be keen to add in the
  future
- `run_tahoe.py`: the script I used to add the tahoe 100M dataset (also look at
  the notebook for info)
- `adding_zhang.py`: the script I used to add the mouse embryo development
  dataset from zhang et. al. 2024 (now available on cellxgene)
- `do_perturb.py`: a notebook I might use to add other perturbation data. I
  haven't used it now.
